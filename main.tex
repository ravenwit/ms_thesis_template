\chapter{Some predictions of the Large Numbers Hypothesis}
The variations with cosmic time predicted by the LNH of the Earth's orbital radius. its mean
angular motion  and other parameters relevent to the discussion of Section 4 are summarized in Table 1 which I have adapted from articles by Van Flandern (1976) and Faulner(1976). Before proceeding, a brief explanation of the entries of the Table 1 needed. 
\newline \\
For Dirac's early LNH the variation of the orbital elements has beeen teken from the discussion of Vinti. In essence, these relationships amount to the assumption tat G varies at $t^{-1}$ and that angular momentum is conserved.

\chapter{The interpretation of the fossil growth patterns}
Let $n_{E}$ be the rotational velocity of the Earth, $n_{M}$ the mean angular momentum of the Moon about the Earth and $n_{S}$ the mean motion of the Earth about the Sub. For the purpose of the analysis of Section 4 it is convenient to express the past variation on the rotation of the Earth in terms of the numbers of sidereal days in the sidereal year $(Y=n_{E}/n_{S})$ and the sidereal month $(M=n_{E}/n_{M})$.
\newline \\
It is ususally assumed that the biological growth patterns found in fossil bivale mollusces preserves a record of the numbers of solar days in the tropical  year $(Y=(n_{E}-n_{S})/n_{S})$, ignoring the small difference between the tropical and sidereal years) and the synodic month $[M'=(n_{E}-n_{S})/(n_{M}-n_{S})]$.
